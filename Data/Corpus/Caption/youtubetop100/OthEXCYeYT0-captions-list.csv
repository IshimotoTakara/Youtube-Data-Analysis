Darian introduced me to Katie,82.32,6.679
[Music],85.76,3.239
that's really tasty I keep wanting to,94.64,4.979
drink more,97.259,2.36
[Music],103.81,3.289
it looks so good,113.96,4.9
like that's a little something what's,116.759,6.86
like the colorful yeah the little cubes,118.86,8.1
that's so cute,123.619,4.871
okay,126.96,4.04
[Music],128.49,6.29
it looks like spinach,131.0,6.78
the flavor is interesting,134.78,6.9
like something I've never tried before,137.78,7.539
at first it was like kind of florally,141.68,8.52
but then it was like more meaty in a way,145.319,8.401
I like it I'm gonna eat ginger I like,150.2,6.36
just eating ginger,153.72,2.84
[Music],173.43,3.079
it's good,178.22,3.72
it's good it's got a nice texture yeah,180.3,4.14
this is some of the better tofu I think,181.94,4.96
I really love tofu so yeah she really,184.44,5.04
loves tofu so you guys are okay with,186.9,5.759
Wasabi oh yes I love Wasabi but I like I,189.48,4.979
like spicy food a lot so it's kind of,192.659,4.16
similar,194.459,2.36
so you guys are from Seattle yeah we are,196.94,6.36
and she's from Texas Texas,200.159,3.141
I think Seattle is very different from,204.379,5.5
Texas in a lot of ways probably food and,206.94,6.36
culture politics,209.879,3.421
yeah we have a lot of seafood but for,217.94,4.299
some reason it's still really expensive,220.62,4.56
so we don't eat it often but the quality,222.239,6.901
is very good yeah yeah so yeah how about,225.18,6.059
here did you go to like a sushi,229.14,5.34
restaurants to eat uh just like uh like,231.239,5.241
one dollar like cheap,234.48,5.7
yeah nothing like special yet but it's,236.48,6.1
expensive yeah this is probably going to,240.18,6.139
be the nicest Sushi one yeah,242.58,3.739
this is my first time having sushi since,247.76,5.86
I came to Japan so yeah yeah I haven't,250.56,4.92
had it yet well I had it in the U.S but,253.62,4.619
so I'm really excited to try it yeah,255.48,6.539
this is like come on next and also sea,258.239,5.061
urchin,262.019,3.96
okay well I've never had that really,263.3,4.54
I've never had that I've never had since,265.979,3.961
you know like what sea urchin looks like,267.84,3.48
I know what it looks it's a spiky one,269.94,3.5
yeah,271.32,2.12
[Music],276.55,5.229
[Music],292.3,4.88
it's really good the sea urchin is,293.96,5.5
pretty soft yeah it's my first time,297.18,6.299
eating it so yeah it melts almost like,299.46,6.44
in your mouth,303.479,5.461
like butter or something yeah it's kind,305.9,6.359
of like butter yeah that makes sense,308.94,3.319
why are you excited,314.78,6.46
I've always wanted to come to Japan I,318.02,5.8
really like Japanese culture like today,321.24,6.36
I went to Meiji Shrine it's so pretty,323.82,6.18
there like and it's in the middle of the,327.6,4.439
city and where I'm from there's like,330.0,4.199
nothing like that everything is very,332.039,4.621
flat and there's no like big trees like,334.199,5.041
that so that's why I really like Japan,336.66,5.039
it's very peaceful,339.24,6.959
what's this this is oh,341.699,4.5
um,347.039,2.061
oh it does taste really good it is it is,351.139,7.361
so soft yeah wow that is so good,354.24,6.679
that is really really good,358.5,5.4
have you had yellow before I've had eel,360.919,5.861
but like this is really good,363.9,5.639
this is really really good eel and I,366.78,4.139
always love the sauce that served with,369.539,3.201
you,370.919,5.84
this is all you can take oh really,372.74,7.14
really wow,376.759,6.461
we'll have to take a taxi anything you,379.88,5.439
think you are surprised when you just,383.22,4.919
arrived here yeah so I think it's the,385.319,4.561
most shocking thing for me was like how,388.139,4.801
quiet Japan is it's just so quiet it's,389.88,5.52
like I can't hear anybody and and so I'm,392.94,3.44
just like,395.4,5.6
this because normally America is so low,396.38,8.4
very loud and there's a lot of noise,401.0,7.44
on the Train everybody is pretty quiet,404.78,6.16
but also another thing especially like,408.44,5.62
today I went shopping like this Japanese,410.94,7.14
staff is so nice and helpful like even,414.06,6.66
though I'm like a foreigner and I don't,418.08,4.26
speak very good Japanese they're always,420.72,3.9
trying to like help me and use the,422.34,4.079
little English that they have help me,424.62,4.139
find the product that I need and it's,426.419,5.161
very nice uh in America I feel like I,428.759,5.521
get ignored I like the store a lot of,431.58,4.5
the time and no one comes to like help,434.28,2.84
me,436.08,5.239
the service is like really nice,437.12,4.199
what's this one red snapper,451.34,5.28
um,454.56,2.06
[Music],462.72,3.069
wow,468.8,5.98
that's so like tender also I was not,471.38,6.7
expecting the Wasabi in there yeah there,474.78,5.52
is Wasabi in there yeah but it adds to,478.08,5.58
the flavor oh it's really good,480.3,5.28
I don't think I've ever had red snapper,483.66,4.08
before like sushi I've had it cooked,485.58,4.559
yeah yeah it was really good wow it's,487.74,5.78
like so soft it's okay,490.139,3.381
just try a little bit,494.479,4.811
[Music],496.2,3.09
[Music],501.3,4.519
right right,503.18,4.59
I really like it,505.819,5.201
[Music],507.77,3.25
yeah,511.319,2.96
it's so good I don't think I've had this,519.14,6.22
before right no I don't think so it's,522.779,4.401
really good,525.36,4.82
it's just everything's so tender,527.18,5.08
keep describing everything as soft,530.18,4.9
because in like in America when you eat,532.26,6.019
sushi it's just like that,535.08,6.18
I haven't had sushi that's like this,538.279,6.06
good before you know,541.26,5.28
someone I thought that's my favorite,544.339,4.861
yeah,546.54,2.66
[Laughter],549.76,7.72
that's very good,554.0,3.48
[Music],582.79,3.129
[Laughter],587.51,4.23
[Music],589.57,5.389
yeah it's a lot more like buttery yeah,591.74,7.02
buttery that's a good word yeah,594.959,7.161
and back,598.76,3.36
[Music],605.06,6.7
I like it okay this one's next one okay,607.459,6.281
so I think it's a little bit chewy I'm a,611.76,4.519
little bit worried,613.74,2.539
I had Squid got a bullet train Sushi,623.48,7.539
yeah like a conveyor Sushi and like that,628.38,5.04
one I could not eat this one is,631.019,4.081
definitely chewy but like the flavor is,633.42,4.02
much better okay yeah yeah my favorite,635.1,4.56
Festival food is the squid on a stick,637.44,7.339
like fried chicken so yes yeah,639.66,5.119
[Music],647.53,5.63
you liked it okay she likes squid okay I,649.82,5.92
went to uh like a nice sushi place and I,653.16,5.4
had the squid there in America this is,655.74,6.56
way better than the one in America,658.56,3.74
marinated,665.06,3.0
[Music],668.67,3.09
you know sometimes people don't like,672.079,4.421
this one in America because it's very,674.519,5.701
fishy flavor definitely fish here but,676.5,6.98
it's still good yeah,680.22,3.26
really,692.279,3.0
got up,699.72,2.72
[Laughter],705.03,6.69
that one's good yeah right that one's,708.8,5.44
really good it's really delicious but I,711.72,3.54
think,714.24,2.52
um if I had to choose between like a,715.26,4.44
roll or like the regular Sushi I think I,716.76,4.519
like the regular series,719.7,4.079
because it's just like more you can,721.279,5.201
enjoy the flavors of the meat more I,723.779,5.461
think that's why I like Sashimi because,726.48,6.12
you can only only taste the fish this is,729.24,5.7
like if you went to America and you had,732.6,4.38
a style like New Year this is like very,734.94,4.32
fancy I don't know about Texas but in,736.98,5.84
Seattle we have it at Chief yeah,739.26,3.56
it opened recently yeah they have a,750.56,7.38
robot serving you yeah,754.38,3.56
yeah so there's such a huge line you,758.04,5.7
have to like put a online like order in,760.86,4.74
the waitlist and waiting like five hours,763.74,5.96
yeah like five hours it's crazy,765.6,4.1
yeah,772.22,3.0
it's only two pieces that's why like we,777.2,4.6
were shocked when we had sushi for the,780.12,4.14
first time at conveyor belt Sushi we saw,781.8,4.8
our bill and usually like the price for,784.26,4.92
six of us was like usually the price for,786.6,3.679
one person,789.18,5.099
and then this is for all of us even the,790.279,8.401
cheap sushi in America is so expensive,794.279,4.401
and the same fish but different parts,798.74,5.98
okay this is akami It's like a red tuna,801.54,6.739
oh okay but it looks like sauce,804.72,3.559
all right,821.66,5.82
yeah it's good it's very good too,823.62,7.56
this one yeah I'm excited to try this,827.48,5.32
one oh wait no no you don't need to,831.18,3.05
right yeah okay,832.8,7.619
